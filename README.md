Our logo is made up of two parts: the snakes with a torch and the wordmark. The snakes with a torch are an approved variation for the Official Python programming language logo. Our community name appears in bold in the wordmark, created from open source font.

## Snakes with a torch logo
The snakes with a torch can be used independently in some situations, but only when the context of the Python La Paz brand is clear.
